# ViciousMockeryInsultGenerator


https://viciousmockeryinsultgenerator.azurewebsites.net/

An Insult Generator created for the Vicious Mockery cantrip used by Bards in Dungeons and Dragons.

Insults are generated by combining adjectives and nouns selected by my 10-year-old son who plays a Halfling Chaotic Neutral Bard named "Sissle Trizzle".

Disclaimer: Some swearing.
