You've always wondered what it would be like to lose a leg. I guess now you'll find out. Your movement speed is permanently reduced by 15 feet while wounded or without the leg. A prosthetic leg or recovery will restore 10 feet of speed. If you choose not to have the leg removed, roll a CON save DC 20 every hour. On each fail, take 1 necrotic damage.  For each day you fail one of these saves, take 1 point of exhaustion. If you walk on the wounded leg, take one of these CON saves for every 200 feet traveled.
